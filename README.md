# Automated-Loan-Eligibility-System
Overview
This project focuses on automating the loan approval process using machine learning techniques. Loan applications often require applicants to provide critical financial details that help lenders determine their eligibility. Manually reviewing these applications can be a time-consuming and error-prone task.

Problem Statement
At ABC Bank, the loan approval process was identified as a major bottleneck due to its reliance on manual evaluation. To address this issue and enhance efficiency, the bank sought a data-driven solution. Recognizing the importance of automation, this project was initiated to develop an intelligent system capable of streamlining the decision-making process.

Objective
The primary aim of this project is to build a machine learning model coupled with a web-based application to classify loan applicants as eligible or ineligible. This tool is designed to assist the bank in making quicker, more consistent, and informed decisions.

Web Application
To ensure usability and accessibility, the project integrates a sleek user interface using responsive HTML and CSS templates from Colorlib, providing a professional front-end for seamless interaction.

This repository contains the source code, model files, and deployment resources for the Loan Approval Prediction system.
